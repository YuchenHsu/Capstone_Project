### Weekly Log / Team Weekly Log / Additional
  - Worked on my own weekly log, contribute to team weeklog.
  - Although I created a overwrite function for video and image, but later on Ethan wrote increment filename if same filename exist in S3 cloudfront server; therefore, my overwrite function is to prevent file to have conflict on SQL when filename is not incremented on S3.

## Recap on your week's goals

### New Elastic Beanstalk server/RDS database/S3 buckets/AWS Lambda to US-West-2 region [Complete]
- Worked on "Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3 Bucket change region to US-West-2" on project board, make new elastic beanstalk server, rds database, s3 buckets on new US-West-2 region, because face blurring feature (AWS Face Rekognition) cannot use ca-central-1 region.
- Made two S3 buckets, one for storing Elastic Beanstalk server uploaded project zip files and server details, another cdk s3 bucket to store AWS Lambda functions zip codes.
- Made two more S3 buckets, input s3 bucket for mp4/mov file face blurring for (AWS Lambda), output s3 bucket for all files to display on webpage.
- Made AWS Lambda to run functions, when mp4/mov video files uploaded to s3 input bucket, send to AWS Face Rekognition, and apply face blurring, and send face blurred video to s3 ouput bucket.

  - [AWS change region setup and AWS Lambda setup Pull Request/Commit](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-13/pull/204)

### Face Blurring Feature on both Elastic Beanstalk server/Local [Complete]
- Worked on "AWS Elastic Beanstalk Face blurring", "Blurring faces", "Choose options UI" and "Choose Options function" on project board, Users are able to choose face blurring feature to their upload and web record videos on video record and video upload page. Video will be uploaded to input s3 bucket if user chose to blur faces; if user chose not to blur faces. video will just only upload to output s3 bucket. After the video is uploaded to s3, users can view the video on view video page with uses a cloudfront link to load videos in output s3 bucket.
- The face blurring feature works on both Elastic Beanstalk server and local.

### FFMPEG for convert webm file to mp4 file format function, local/Elastic Beanstalk FFMPEG setup[Complete]
- Worked on "FFMPEG installation and configuration for both local and AWS Elastic Beanstalk" on project board, before uploading the video record, video files need to be in either mp4 or mov file format to Input S3 bucket, because the AWS Lambda functions only trigger when mp4 or mov files upload to Input S3 bucket, and start face blurring.
- FFMPEG function will convert the web recorded video(webm file format) to mp4 file format.
- Setup FFMPEG application on both elastic beanstalk and local.
- Update the installation for ffmpeg python in requirement.txt.
