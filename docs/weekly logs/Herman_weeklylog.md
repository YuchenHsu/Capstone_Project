If the user does not exist, then a message saying will show. I am now in the phase of writing a unit test for this. I should have probably written it prior to the functions for the add contact which I will try to be mindful of for future.

- Recap on your week's goals-Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone? For term 2 week 4 I worked on the add contact branch and made modifications to the page.

There is also a list of existing users with add contact buttons next to each user beneath the search bar. You can also search a user by typing a couple letters and search and the results will match the most closely associated users to add. Lastly I wrote a selenium test and updated unit tests for this.

- Herman -> Herman Sood -> Herman Sood

- Recap on your week's goals-Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone? For term 2 week 12, I worked on the notification indicator feature in which the receiver will get a notification if they receive a friend request or a video request for example and this is seen as a number within a red border on any page that they are on (for example on the home page or on the profile page) directly on the notifications bar. If the receiver gets multiple notifications the number increments and once they go to the notifications page the notifications indicator sets back to 0 since the notifications are now all marked as read. I also updated the selenium test for the notification test to highlight the indicator addition.
